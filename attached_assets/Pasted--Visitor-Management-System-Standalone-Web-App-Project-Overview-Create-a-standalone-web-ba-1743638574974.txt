### Visitor Management System (Standalone Web App
#### Project Overview
Create a standalone web-based Visitor Management System (VMS) with a clean architecture, beautiful user interfaces, and a robust API for integration with other applications (such as the NL Time Controller App). The system should have a visitor-facing portal, an admin dashboard, and a secure backend with a well-documented API.

#### Step 1: App Setup
- Create a new project for the Visitor Management System.
- Organize the project structure in a clear and maintainable way.
- Set up necessary configurations and environment settings.

#### Step 2: Backend Setup
- Design a structured and efficient database to store visitor information and visit logs.
- Implement API endpoints that allow for visitor check-in, check-out, and data retrieval.
- Ensure the backend can handle multiple concurrent users and provide reliable performance.

#### Step 3: Frontend Visitor Portal
- Design a clean and intuitive user interface for visitors to check in and check out.
- Include fields like Full Name, Email (optional), Phone Number, and Year of Birth.
- Display the visitorâ€™s age automatically after entering the year of birth.
- Provide clear feedback on the success or failure of actions.
- Design a multi step form

#### Step 4: Admin Dashboard
- Create a simple and efficient dashboard for administrators to monitor and manage visitors.
- Include features like real-time status updates, visitor history, and manual check-out.
- Allow administrators to export data in common formats for analysis.
- Ensure the dashboard is accessible and easy to use.

#### Step 5: Integration with NL Time Controller
- Create robust and secure API endpoints to allow the NL Time Controller to fetch visitor information.
- Implement features that sync visitor data as customer profiles when selected.
- Ensure secure and authenticated communication between applications.

#### Step 6: Additional Requirements
- Maintain a clean and consistent codebase with comprehensive comments.
- Implement error handling for edge cases and unexpected inputs.
- Provide thorough documentation for developers and administrators.

#### Final Considerations
Ensure the system is built with scalability and modularity in mind. Focus on performance, usability, and maintainability to facilitate future updates and integrations.
