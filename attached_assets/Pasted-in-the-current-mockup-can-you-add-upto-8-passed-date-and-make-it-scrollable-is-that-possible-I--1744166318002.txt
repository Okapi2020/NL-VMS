in the current mockup can you add upto 8 passed date and make it scrollable, is that possible?

I'll update the mockup to include more historical visits (8 past dates) and make the timeline section scrollable. This will demonstrate how the interface handles a longer history while keeping the UI clean.


Visitor Timeline Mockup
Interactive artifact ∙ Version 2 
I've updated the mockup to include 8 historical visits spanning different dates, and made the timeline section scrollable. The updates include:

Scrollable Timeline Area: I've added a max-height limitation with overflow-y-auto to create a scrollable container for the timeline. This ensures the UI stays compact while still allowing access to the complete history.
8 Past Visits: The timeline now includes visits on:
8 April 2025 (4 visits on the same day)
7 April 2025 (1 visit)
2 April 2025 (1 visit)
25 March 2025 (1 visit)
10 March 2025 (1 visit)
Visit Variety: I've added different visit durations (from 0 minutes to over 2 hours) and different visit types (Ordinary, Cancelled, Short, Extended) to show how the interface handles various scenarios.
Visual Distinction: Each visit maintains the timeline dot and connecting line, which helps users track the chronological sequence even when scrolling.
This approach allows your interface to handle extensive visitor history while keeping the UI clean and organized. Users can easily scroll through a visitor's complete history without cluttering the main interface.

The scrollable container will be particularly useful for frequent visitors with extensive histories, while still providing all the necessary information in a visually appealing timeline format.

Can you add like a "load more" for when there are a much longer history?

I'll add a "Load More" button at the end of the timeline to handle cases with extensive visit history.


Visitor Timeline Mockup
Interactive artifact ∙ Version 3 
I've added a "Load More" button at the end of the visitor timeline that indicates there are additional visits available to view. This enhancement provides several benefits:

Performance Optimization: Instead of loading potentially hundreds of visits at once, the interface can load them in manageable batches.
User Feedback: The button explicitly states how many additional visits are available ("15 visites précédentes"), giving users clear expectations.
Visual Design: The button includes a downward arrow icon to indicate that clicking will reveal more content below, following standard UI patterns.
Responsive Design: The button spans the full width of the timeline, making it an easy target to click regardless of device.
Styled Consistently: The button styling matches the rest of the interface, using the same color scheme, border radius, and hover effects.
This approach is particularly valuable for visitors with extensive histories where displaying all visits at once could lead to performance issues or excessive scrolling. It provides a good balance between showing recent history immediately while making older history accessible when needed.

Your developers could implement this with pagination or infinite scrolling, depending on your system's architecture and performance considerations.
