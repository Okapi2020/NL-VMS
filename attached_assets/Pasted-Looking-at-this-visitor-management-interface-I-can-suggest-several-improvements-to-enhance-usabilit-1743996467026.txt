Looking at this visitor management interface, I can suggest several improvements to enhance usability and visual organization. Here's my analysis and recommendations:
Current Issues

Limited visual hierarchy and distinction between important information
All columns have similar visual weight
Check-in/out dates and times are separated in a way that makes duration calculation difficult
No clear status indicators for active visitors
Actions column lacks descriptive icons
Long durations displayed without clear formatting

Improvement RecommendationsImproved Visitor Management InterfaceInteractive artifact Here are my specific recommendations for improving the visitor management interface:

Improved Layout Organization

Group related information (visitor details in one column, contact info in another)
Use visual hierarchy to emphasize important information


Better Visual Status Indicators

Add color indicators for check-in/check-out times
Format duration as a badge with appropriate color coding
Make badge IDs visually distinct with a background color


Enhanced Usability Features

Clearer selection mechanism with visual feedback
More distinct action buttons with recognizable icons
Better pagination controls
Improved filtering options


Responsive Design Elements

More compact layout that still maintains readability
Better handling of long text (like email addresses)
Consistent spacing and alignment


Functional Improvements

Group check-in and check-out information in a logical way
Add visual cues for status (active/checked-out)
Improve the contacts section with clickable links for email/phone


Modern UI Elements

Card-based design with proper shadows and rounded corners
Hover states for interactive elements
Better typography with proper hierarchy



The redesigned interface maintains all the original functionality while improving visual organization and user experience. Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of the redesign in more detail?RetryENSuggested Solution:
* Replace both the edit and delete buttons with a single view button.
* When the admin clicks on the view button, a popup window should appear (the same popup that currently appears when clicking the edit icon).
* Inside the popup window, provide options for edit and delete. This way, the table remains clean and less crowded, and actions are consolidated within the popup.EditThat's an excellent suggestion to further streamline the interface. Consolidating the actions into a single view button with a popup for additional options will definitely make the table cleaner and less cluttered.Improved Visitor Management InterfaceInteractive artifact ∙ Version 2 Improved Visitor Management InterfaceInteractive artifact ∙ Version 3 Improved Visitor Management InterfaceInteractive artifact ∙ Version 4 Improved Visitor Management InterfaceInteractive artifact ∙ Version 5 Improved Visitor Management InterfaceInteractive artifact ∙ Version 6 Improved Visitor Management InterfaceInteractive artifact ∙ Version 7 I've implemented your suggested solution by:

Replacing the dual action buttons with a single View button:

Changed the separate edit and delete buttons to a single, cleaner "View" button
Added an eye icon for better visual recognition
Used a slightly larger button style to improve clickability


Created a detailed modal popup:

The modal appears when clicking the View button
Well-organized with separate sections for personal info, contact details, and visit information
All the visitor's information is presented in a clear, readable format


Consolidated actions within the popup:

Added prominent Edit and Delete buttons at the bottom of the modal
These buttons are visually distinct with appropriate colors and icons
Positioned in their own section to avoid accidental clicks


Enhanced user experience:

Added a close button in the top-right corner of the modal
Used an overlay background to focus attention on the modal
Added visual structure with section headers and card-like containers



This approach provides several benefits:

Cleaner table interface with less visual clutter
More space to display visitor information in a structured way
Reduced risk of accidental actions (like deletion)
Better context for making decisions about editing or deleting records
